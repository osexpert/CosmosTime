have Adjust-methods (or Advance) that can move us 1 day ahead (serokell_tztime_test, adding 24h move 2 days ahead).

ZonedTime.AddLocalDays
ZonedTime.AddLocalDays

ClockTime, ClockOffsetTime, ClockZoneTime

public static UtcZoneTime ToUtcZoneTime(this ClockTime ct, TimeZoneInfo tz)//, Func<TimeSpan[], TimeSpan> chooseOffset)
